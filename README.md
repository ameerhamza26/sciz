# ScizzorApp

## Description
* This folder contains only the mobile app code
* The server side code is in another folder
* gitignore file has been added to remove user generated folders (node_modules, platforms etc)
* When you clone this directory onto your machine, you have to run npm install to get the dependencies

### Code Managament
* Henceforth, all code management will be done via GIT
* To make a change, a new branch must be created based on the change(adding a new feature, fixing a particular bug etc)
* A pull request must be made afterwards and this needs to be approved by the team to ensure quality code management
* The created branch would then be merged with the master branch in the end

### Updating the code to GIT
* "git add --all" to add all changes from your machine
* "git commit -m "commit name"" to commit the changes
* "git push origin master"

### Updating the code to IONIC PRO (Ionic View)
* "git add --all" to add all changes from your machine
* "git commit -m "commit name"" to commit the changes
* "git push ionic master"
* If the app is not yet linked, run "ionic link" and select the right app. This would make the ionic pro a remote repository
* If login is also needed - Username - arinze.ibekwe@yahoo.com - Password - arinze10
